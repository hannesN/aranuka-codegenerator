This project provides a library to generate Java POJOs based on Topic Maps schemas. The generated classes will have annotations for Aranuka, the Pojo to Topic Map mapper ( see https://github.com/hannesN/aranuka ).

In addtion it is possible to add Kuria annotations to create SWT input masks based on the model code.

Another flag will generate helper classes for another Topic Maps Lab project: Genny - The Generic Editor Software Developement Kit. This project will be open source soon.
