This project provides a library to generate Java POJOs based on Topic Maps schemas. The generated classes will have annotations for Aranuka, the Pojo to Topic Map mapper ( see http://code.google.com/p/aranuka/ ).

In addtion it is possible to add Kuria annotations to create SWT input masks based on the model code.

Another flag will generate helper classes for another Topic Maps Lab project: Genny - The Generic Editor Software Developement Kit. This project will be open source soon.
